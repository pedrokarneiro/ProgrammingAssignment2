Or you might click [here to go directly to my "pedro" branch](https://github.com/pedrokarneiro/ProgrammingAssignment2/tree/pedro) under this very same fork.

As from my understanding of the assignment instructions, I decided to push my cachematrix.R to my created branch "pedro".

Please note: My submission **is not** under the master branch **but under** the "pedro" branch.

Please select the "pedro" branch at the branch ![Green button](https://confluence.atlassian.com/download/attachments/304578655/branch_12.png?version=3&modificationDate=1400595268047&api=v2) button, near the green button at the top left of this fork page so you will be able to see my submission and check the SHA code.
